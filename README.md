# Roll a Ball VR-Game by Simon Demuth
Created at THI 2024

This is a VR-Game, where the player has to grab and tilt a wood-gameboard in order to navigate the metal-ball. The goal is to collect all yellow-cubes, without falling through a hole in the game-board.
The game features a bouncy ball, nice textures, holes in the game-board and point-stats shown to the user.
